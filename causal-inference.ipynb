    "### Intention-to-treat (ITT) versus per-protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "An intention-to-treat analysis compares outcomes in the subjects assigned to treatment to the subjects assigned to control, whether or not the subjects assigned to a treatment received it.\n",
    "It can be though of as measuring the effect of _prescribing_ treatment, in contrast to the effect of _receiving_ treatment.\n",
    "It is common in experiments on humans that some subjects do not receive the treatment they were randomly assigned.\n",
    "Such _non-compliance_ may result from subjects breaking the blinding (e.g., noticing that their \"treatment\" is\n",
    "a sugar pill and seeking other treatment rather than receiving only the placebo) or seeking alternative treatments.\n",
    "For instance, this was an issue in the TOGETHER study of the effect of ivermectin on COVID-19, in which a substantial\n",
    "fraction of patients assigned to receive a placebo bought ivermectin over the counter and took it.\n",
    "Non-compliance may also result from subjects simply not doing as they are told.\n",
    "In general, ITT is the preferred analysis, but especially when compliance rates are low, _per-protocol_ (PP) analyisis, which compares outcomes for subjects who actually received the treatment to outcomes for subjects who actually received placebo (and no other treatment) may be more informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in [a randomized study of the effect of colonoscopy screenings on colorectal cancer and cancer deaths published in 2022](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208375),\n",
    "only 42% of subjects who were \"invited\" to receive a colonoscopy actually underwent the procedure. \n",
    "The apparent effect of \"inviting\" subjects to receive a colonoscopy was small:\n",
    "the risk of death from colorectal cancer at 10 years was 0.28% in the invited group and 0.31% in the control group,\n",
    "an ITT relative risk of $0.28/0.31 = 0.9$.\n",
    "This led [major news outlets to report](https://www.statnews.com/2022/10/09/in-gold-standard-trial-colonoscopy-fails-to-reduce-rate-of-cancer-deaths/) that colonoscopies do not prevent\n",
    "cancer deaths. \n",
    "A better description might be that _recommending_ colonoscopies does not appear to have a large\n",
    "effect on deaths.\n",
    "In the same study, the 10-year risk of death among subjects who actually received colonoscopies was 0.15%, a \n",
    "PP relative risk of $0.15/0.3 = 0.5$, substantially stronger evidence that _receiving_ a colonoscopy has value.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for PP it is crucial to know _why_ subjects did not receive their assigned treatment, since self-selection \n",
    "and other processes can lead to substantial biases in estimates of the effect of treatment.\n",
    "For example, imagine a trial of a treatment for a disease.\n",
    "Suppose that treatment is effective, and that subjects who were assigned a placebo and and get worse break\n",
    "protocol and take an active treatment instead.\n",
    "Then the PP analysis will be biased against finding that the treatment is effective.\n",
    "Conversely, suppose that treatment actually makes some people worse, and that those people stop taking\n",

    "Then a PP analysis will tend to hide the fact that treatment hurts some subjects.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is common in some kinds of experiments that the outcomes for some subjects cannot be observed, or can be observed\n",
    "only partially.\n",
    "For instance, in experiments on people that involve followup over time, some subjects might simply not show up\n",
    "for one or more followup examinations, resulting in _missing data_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In experiments involving how long something takes, for instance, time to \"failure\" or \"death,\" some subjects might\n",
    "not have experienced \"failure\" by the time the experiment ends.\n",
    "The experimenter knows that such subjects are \"still alive\" when the experiment ended, but they do not\n",
    "know how long it will be until those subjects \"die.\" \n",
    "That is, rather than observing the failure time itself,\n",
    "the experimenter observes that the failure time is greater than some value.\n",
    "This is an example of _(right) censoring_.\n",
    "There are special techniques for dealing with missing data (including subjects lost to followup) and censoring.\n",
