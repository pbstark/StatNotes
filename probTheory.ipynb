    "\n",
    "This theory of probability is the oldest.\n",
    "It originated in the study of games of chance, such as dice games and card games.\n",
    "In the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes, probability assignments depend on the\n",
    "assertion that no particular outcome is preferred over any other by Nature; generally,\n",
    "arguments that Nature should show no preference among the outcomes appeal to the\n",
    "symmetry of the system studied (such as a &quot;fair&quot; coin or die).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a given experiment or trial has $n$ possible outcomes among\n",
    "which&mdash;it is assumed&mdash;Nature should show no preference, this\n",
    "theory defines them to be _equally likely_.\n",
    "The probability of each outcome is then $100\\%/n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying this theory of probability involves arguing that no particular outcome should occur\n",
    "in preference to another, typically by appeal to physical symmetries\n",
    "or other considerations&mdash;e.g., that there is no reason one marble would be predisposed\n",
    "to turn up rather than another in drawing a marble from a well-stirred bowl of marbles.\n",
    "Laplace's _Principle of Insufficient Reason_ asserts that if there \n",
    "is no reason to think that a set of outcomes is not equally likely, they should \n",
    "be taken to be equally likely.  This is poor logic: no evidence of a difference \n",
    "is not the same as evidence of no difference.  The fallacy is called \n",
    "_Appeal to Ignorance_. See also \n",
    "Stark and Freedman, 2003.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a coin is balanced well, there is no reason for it to\n",
    "land heads in preference to tails when it is tossed vigorously,\n",
    "so according to the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes,\n",
    "the probability that the coin lands heads is equal to the\n",
    "probability that the coin lands tails, and both are 100%/2 = 50%.\n",
    "(This ignores the nearly impossible outcomes that the coin does not\n",
    "land at all or lands balanced on its edge.)\n",
    "Similarly, if a die is fair\n",
    "(properly balanced) the chance that when it is rolled vigorously\n",
    "it lands with the side with one spot on top (the chance that the die _shows_\n",
    "one spot) is the same as the chance that it shows two spots or three\n",
    "spots or four spots or five spots or six spots: 100%/6, about 16.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "If an event consists of more than one possible\n",
    "outcome, the chance of the event is the number of ways it can occur, divided by the total\n",
    "number of things that could occur.\n",
    "For example, the chance that a die lands showing an even number of spots\n",
    "is the number of ways it could land showing an even number of spots\n",
    "(3, namely, landing showing 2, 4, or 6 spots), divided by the total\n",
    "number of things that could occur\n",
    "(6, namely, landing showing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 spots).\n",
    "Since the total number of possible outcomes is $n$, the maximum possible\n",
    "probability of any event is $100% \\times n/n = 100\\%$.\n",
    "Thus, in the Theory of Equally Likely Outcomes, probabilities are between 0%\n",
    "and 100%, as claimed."

    "independently, the ratio of the number of times the coin lands heads to the\n",
    "total number of tosses approaches a limiting value of 50% as the number\n",
