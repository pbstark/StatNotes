    "Basic problem set up: we observe items sequentially. Each item has a label, $y$, which could be numerical or categorical.\n",
    "There is some black-box model that makes a prediction $\\hat{y}$ of the value of $y$ for the next item, \n",
    "generally using side information $x$ (e.g., covariates).\n",
    "The predictor can \"learn\" from previous cases: it does not have to stay the same over time.\n",
    "After each prediction $\\hat{y}$ is made, the true label $y$ is revealed.\n",
    "Thus,  $(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_{n−1}, y_{n−1})$ and $x_n$ are available to predict $y_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is: given an acceptable error probability $\\epsilon$, construct a \"prediction region\" $\\Gamma^\\epsilon$ of labels that contains the label of the next item with probability at least $1-\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic assumption of conformal prediction is that the cases are _exchangeable_, which is true if they are IID. \n",
    "(There has been work on weakening that assumption: see, e.g., Foygel, R.B., E.J. Candes, A. Ramdas, and R.J. Tibshirani, 2022.  Conformal prediction beyond exchangeability, https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13415.)\n",
