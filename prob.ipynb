    "\n",
    "In probability, we assume we know what the world is like, and predict what we would then see.\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, we make observations and use them to learn something about the world.\n",
    "That generally requires a mathematical model for how the obervations were generated, to relate the observations to properties of the world.\n",
    "Sometimes, that model arises naturally from knowledge of the process that generated the data,\n",
    "for instance, a randomized experiment or a physical measurement where the\n",
    "underlying physics is understood.\n",
    "In other cases, the model is basically an assumption.\n",
    "When the model does not have a firm basis in actual knowledge, inferences are suspect.\n",
    "As Robert L. Parker says, \"the more you assume, the less you know.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is like a _forward problem_ in science or engineering: the the physics, including any parameters,\n",
    "is known. The issue is to predict what will be observed, up to instrumental error and other noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics, at least inferential statistics, is like an _inverse problem_. The physics is known\n",
    "but there are unknown parameters. The issue is to use the (noisy) data to learn about parameters\n",
    "of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a combination of mathematics and philosophy.\n",
