    "$E$-values are a way of quantifying evidence about a statistical hypothesis. \n",
    "They are closely related to $P$-values, but more general in many ways, and possibly easier to understand.\n",
    "In particular (paraphrasing Shafer, 2021):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $E$-values are like the returns on a bet. Most people know it's possible to win a bet with long odds by having good luck, or by identifying good bets where the payoff odds don't reflect the chance odds. Fewer people understand $P$-values.\n",
    "It's common to think that a small $P$-value means the alternative is true or that the probability that the null is true is small--two common misconceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Any particular bet implies an alternative hypothesis. The betting score is the likelihood of the alternative\n",
    "divided by the likelihood of the null. Likelihood ratios have intuitive appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Power calculations involve a fixed significance level, not a $P$-value, so there's no direct analog of power for $P$-values. In contrast, a bet also implies a target: a value for the betting score that might be hoped for if the alternative hypothesis is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The validity of $P$-values generally requires pre-specifying the entire analysis, but betting scores can include deliberate attempts to improve one's \"fortune\" by using all currently available data to inform the next bet.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ For a function to be a $P$-value, its distribution must be dominated by the uniform distribution under the null. For a function to be an $E$-value, all that needs to be true is that it is nonnegative and its expected value is at most 1 under the null. That is generally a much easier condition to guarantee."
