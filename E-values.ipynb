    "$E$-values are a way of quantifying evidence about a statistical hypothesis. \n",
    "They are closely related to $P$-values, but more general in many ways, and possibly easier to understand.\n",
    "In particular (paraphrasing Shafer, 2021):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An $E$-value is the observed value of a nonnegative random variable whose expected value under the null is 1: $\\mathbb{E}_0 E = 1$. In contrast, a $P$-value is the observed value of a nonnegative random variable whose probability distribution under the null is dominated by the uniform distribution: $\\mathbb{P}_0 \\{P \\le x\\} \\le x$, $\\forall x \\in [0, 1]$. It is generally a much more straightforward to construct $E$-values than $P$-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ $E$-values are like the returns on a bet. Most people know it's possible to win a bet with long odds by having good luck, or by identifying good bets where the payoff odds don't reflect the chance odds. Fewer people understand $P$-values. It's common to think that a small $P$-value means the alternative is true or that the probability that the null is true is small--two common misconceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Any particular bet implies an alternative hypothesis. The betting score is the likelihood of the alternative divided by the likelihood of the null. Likelihood ratios have intuitive appeal.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Power calculations involve a fixed significance level, not a $P$-value, so there's no direct analog of power for $P$-values. In contrast, a bet also implies a target: a value for the betting score that might be expected if the alternative hypothesis is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The validity of $P$-values generally requires pre-specifying the entire analysis, but betting scores can include deliberate attempts to improve one's \"fortune\" by using all currently available data to inform the next bet.  Betting scores thus may correspond better to how Science is conducted: a single hypothesis might be tested many times, and each experiment (including its design, what is measured, and the test used) might be informed by previous experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Betting scores can often be combined by multiplication, which corresponds to \"reinvesting\" the winnings in future bets, and can always be combined using averages (with or without weights). In contrast, combining $P$-values is much more subtle.\n",
