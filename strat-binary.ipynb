    "# Inference about binary populations from stratified samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Many (if not most) books on survey sampling recommend stratified sampling, but do not address how to construct exact or conservative confidence sets from stratified samples.\n",
    "Instead, they recommend approximate confidence intervals based on the normal approximation.\n",
    "As we have seen, confidence intervals based on the normal approximation can have terrible coverage\n",
    "probability in practice--much lower than they claim to have--even for large sample sizes, depending on \n",
    "the population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter constructs conservative and exact tests and confidence bounds for the population total (or mean) of a binary population from a stratified random sample, where the sample from each stratum is a simple random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three approaches are discussed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Wright's method, which finds simultaneous confidence bounds for the number of 1s in each stratum using Šidák's method, then adds the bounds.\n",
    "1. Wendell & Schmee's method (1996, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1996.10476950), which is based on inverting tests of hypotheses that specify the number of 1s in each stratum. The test statistic is $\\hat{p}$, the unbiased estimate of the overall population proportion. The $P$-value for the hypothesis that the total number of 1s in the population is $g$ is the largest $P$-value across all ways of allocating $g$ ones across the strata. Finding the largest $P$-value involves examining a combinatorial number of allocations, so the method becomes infeasible as the number of strata grows (beyond approximately 3).\n",
    "1. A new method based on inverting tests of hypotheses that specify the number of 1s in each stratum, where such hypotheses are viewed as an _intersection hypothesis_: the intersection of separate hypotheses about the number of 1s in each stratum by itself.  The test statistic is Fisher's combining function (or any other $P$-value combining function) applied to the $P$-values from the individual stratumwise tests. The $P$-value for the hypothesis that the total number of 1s in the population is $g$ is the largest $P$-value across all ways of allocating $g$ ones across the strata. In contrast to the Wendell-Schmee method, that maximization can be performed constructively rather than requiring a combinatorial search. That makes the method applicable even when the number of strata is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter derives and illustrates specific methods for a particular problem, but along the way it illustrates a number of\n",
    "broadly useful things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simultaneous confidence intervals based on independent observations via Šidák's inequality.\n",
    "1. Finding a confidence set for a multidimensional parameter by finding simultaneously valid confidence sets for the individual components of the parameter.\n",
    "1. Finding a confidence set for a function of a (multidimensional) parameter by looking at the range of the function over a confidence set for the (multidimensional) parameter.\n",
    "1. Maximizing $P$-values over nuisance parameters, a general approach that can be applied widely to test composite hypotheses, including situations with nuisance parameters.\n",
    "1. Representing composite nulls as a union of intersection nulls.\n",
    "1. Combining independent $P$ values using Fisher's combining function.\n",
    "1. Different test statistics that produce valid tests in a given problem can have vastly different statistical performance (power) and computational performance (speed).\n",
    "1. Some combinatorial problems can be solved extremely quicly by greedy algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximizing the $P$-value over all allocations of $G$ ones across $S$ strata\n",
    "is combinatorially complex: Feller's \"bars and stars\" argument shows that there are $\\binom{G+S-1}{S-1}$ ways to allocate $G$ indistinguishable objects among $S$ strata.\n",
    "(Some of those can be ruled out, for instance if $G$ exceeds the size of any stratum.)\n",
    "For $S=10$ strata of size $N_s = 400$ and $G = 300$, \n",
    "there are roughly 6.3e+16 allocations: impractical by any standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter replicates Wendell & Schmee's method in python\n",
    "and introduces a different conservative strategy for stratified inference, \n",
    "also based on maximizing the $P$-value over the nuisance parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic Wendell & Schmee use is sensible, but only one of infinitely many.\n",
    "A new method developed here uses a different test statistic: a $P$-value combining function (e.g., Fisher's combining function) applied\n",
    "to the tail probabilities of individual hypergeometric counts for the separate strata.\n",
    "A naive approach to maximizing this $P$-value over the nuisance parameters \n",
    "would also involve a search over a combinatorial number of possible allocations.\n",
    "However:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No combinatorial search is necessary: an allocation that yields the largest\n",
    "$P$-values and corresponding confidence bounds can be constructed by a simple\n",
    "algorithm in order $N \\log N$ operations, where $N$ is the number of items in the population. \n",
    "Runtime can be reduced further to $O( N \\log S )$. \n",
    "The number of strata has little effect on the complexity of the calculation.\n",
    "2. The resulting tests and confidence intervals are in some cases sharper than those of\n",
    "Wendell and Schmee, in particular when the strata are heterogeneous--which is often the justification for drawing a stratified sample in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below implements Wright's method; the brute-force approach (enumerate all ways of allocating a given number of ones across the strata, find the maximum $P$-value across those allocations); the new, more efficient approach, which exploits special structure of the problem; and the Wendell & Schmee approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "It replicates a number of calculations in the Wendell & Schmee paper.\n",
    "Several algorithms for finding confidence intervals are implemented, including a line \n",
    "search, a bisection-like method that takes advantage of the fact that the\n",
    "possible values are integers, and a fast constructive algorithm for the new method."
